Files of what I've made in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Animate as a beginner.

Personal Notes:

By Feb. 21, another animation file will be uploaded. The Adobe Animate directory will be updated to include a YouTube link to the animation videos for those who wish to view them without downloading.

By Feb. 21, a directory will be created to contain the 3D models Iâ€™ve made in SketchUp.

Internal Change Animation Context:
The animation begins with the character being consumed by the visual representation of their dark thoughts, symbolizing their depression. When the white ball strikes them, the character is knocked out and sees a flurry of vibrant colors and shapes. The white ball signifies a moment of clarity for the character, while the colorful imagery represents a rebirth of their personality and renewed wonder for the world around them. When the character opens their eyes again, they no longer see a gray haze but a beautiful sky, signaling the internal change they've undergone that allows them to once again see the beauty in the world.
